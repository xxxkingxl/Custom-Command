# 📲 AppLauncher Guide
## 🗂️ Where are the app located?
* The apps are located in the Apps folder Located in the CCMD folder.
* The apps Are Sorted into categories and can not be put in the apps root directory, but need to be placed in to 1 sub folder.
## How do you add an app?
1. go to: ``C:\Users\YourUsername\CCMD\Apps\``
2. Think of an category for the app
3. place it in that category
4. if that category doesnt exist: you create an new folder with tat name with only numers, letters, underscores and dashes (no spaces or /\|...)
5. if it exists: place it in the correct category folder
## Format:
* To add apps (/file locations/websites) you need to place shortcuts to the app or file location (ect.) in one of the folders of the apps folder.
* the applauncher accepst only the following file types: [Windows] .lnk .url | [Linux] not supported yet
* the app supports having multiple shortcuts to one app (makes you have aliases for one app), **BUT** you CANT have 2 shortcuts with the same name, then the app will problebly go through the folders by alphabetical order and pick the one it sees the first.
* to create shortcuts:
  - [Windows}
    * Apps:
      1. go to the desktop
      2. open start
      3. (win 11:) go to all apps (win 10:) idk anymore, forgot
      4. go to the ap you want shortcut for (problebly press one of the symbols and chose the first symbol of the app)
      5. drag app to desktop to create shortcut
      * OR go to the start menu folder if its not an microsoft store app (and if you know what you are doing)
    * Directories
      1. go to the directory
      2. copy the path of the directory
      3. make an new shortcut
      4. paste path in shortcut
      5. done
    * Files
      1. do the same as directories but for the file OR:
      2. go to the file
      3. Right click the file
      4. press: make shortcut
      5. done
    * Websites
      1. go to the site you want
      2. copy the url
      3. make an new shortcut
      4. paste url instead of an file path
      5. done
  - [Linux]
    * Not Yet Discoverd by me (when developing linux version I will search how to do that)
* after you created shortcut, you move it to the correct category and give it an name (you dont have to remember, but you will need to read and type it, sometimes a lot do)
* example format apps folder: (from my install, so real life example)
